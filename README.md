# wegfinder-download-link-generator

Added to the body of the wegfinder-website, this script creates a functioning downloadlink for each element with the class "downloadbutton". Either basic matomo tracking parameters will be added or parameters already added to the page-URL will be attached to the link to pass the tracking on to the clients.
